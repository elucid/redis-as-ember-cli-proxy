# Using Redis as a proxy with ember-cli

# Agenda

1. What is going on here?

2. Why do this?

3. How it works

4. Caveats

5. The future

# What is going on here?

---

# What is going on here?

- instead of using `ember server --proxy http://local.api.host:8080`

---

# What is going on here?

- instead of using `ember server --proxy http://local.api.host:8080`

- write `index.html` to redis on each ember-cli build

# What is going on here?

- write `index.html` to redis on each ember-cli build

- API app reads `index.html` out of redis and serves it

# Why do this?

---

# Why do this?

- login page is in the API app

---

# Why do this?

- login page is in the API app

  - and you can't or don't want to change that

---

# Why do this?

- login page is in the API app

  - and you can't or don't want to change that

- need to serialize per-user state into initial payload

---

# Why do this?

- login page is in the API app

  - and you can't or don't want to change that

- need to serialize per-user state into initial payload

  - session info

---

# Why do this?

- login page is in the API app

  - and you can't or don't want to change that

- need to serialize per-user state into initial payload

  - session info

  - model data needed to bootstrap page

---

# Why do this?

- login page is in the API app

  - and you can't or don't want to change that

- need to serialize per-user state into initial payload

  - session info

  - model data needed to bootstrap page

- both require proxying ember app through Rails/Django/Express app

# How it works

---

# How it works

- I made a little addon [ember-cli-redis-proxy](https://github.com/elucid/ember-cli-redis-proxy)

---

# How it works

- uses configuration as per [ember-cli-deploy](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-deploy)

```javascript
// config/deploy.js
module.exports = {
  development: {
    buildEnv: 'development',
    store: {
      type: 'redis',  // this can be omitted because it is the default
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 6379
    },
    assets: {
      // ...
    }
  },

  // other environments
};
```

---

# How it works

- uses configuration as per [ember-cli-deploy](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-deploy)

  - (doesn't actually share implementation details with [ember-cli-deploy](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-deploy))

---

# How it works

- uses ember-cli addon `postBuild` hook to write `index.html` build output to redis

???

- note on difficulty figuring this out

# Caveats

---

# Caveats

- need to setup fingerprinting in development mode

---

# Caveats

- need to setup fingerprinting in development mode

```javascript

// Brocfile.js
var EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');

var fingerprintOptions = {
  enabled: true,
  extensions: ['js', 'css', 'png', 'jpg', 'gif']
};

var env = process.env.EMBER_ENV || 'development';

switch (env) {
  case 'development':
    fingerprintOptions.prepend = 'http://localhost:4200/';
    break;
  case 'production':
    fingerprintOptions.prepend = 'https://your.cdn.com/';
    break;
}

var app = new EmberApp({
  fingerprint: fingerprintOptions
});
```
